# rememberwhenvite

Remember When was an idea from Elizar Garcia (the project lead). 
During Code Stack Academy Elizar had acquired Lerrisa and Jeremy to his team. 

Built using React | TypeScript | Bootstrap | C# | Azure Databases/SQL
Originally made with regular React later moved to Vite for audio feature.
 Backend repository: https://github.com/EXgarcia/RememberWhen.
 

Elizar was the main backend API builder and SQL database setup and connection. Along with some help with editing and deleting memories.
Lerrisa was the only UI/UX Designer building from scratch. Along with Frontend desktop responsiveness.
Jeremy was the main frontend builder and builder for general file structure. Along with doing some API work with the folders.
