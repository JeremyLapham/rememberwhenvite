# Remember When

Remember When was an idea from Elizar Garcia (the project lead). 
During Code Stack Academy Elizar had acquired Lerrisa and Jeremy to his team. 
This website allows users to save and create folders that store memories.

Built using React | TypeScript | Bootstrap | C# | Azure Databases/SQL
Originally made with regular React later moved to Vite for audio feature.
 Backend repository: https://github.com/EXgarcia/RememberWhen.
 

Elizar was the main backend API builder and SQL database setup and connection. Along with some help with editing and deleting memories.
Lerrisa was the only UI/UX Designer building from scratch. Along with Frontend desktop responsiveness.
Jeremy was the main frontend builder and builder for general file structure. Along with doing some API work with the folders.

<h2>Features</h2>
